# Cardano DEX/CEX Arbitrage Bot ü§ñ

An open-source arbitrage bot for maintaining price consistency between Cardano DEXs and Gleec Exchange. This bot monitors price differences and executes trades automatically when profitable opportunities arise.

## Overview

- Monitoring price differences in real-time
- Executing automated buy/sell orders when profitable opportunities are found
- Managing the complete trade cycle including withdrawals and deposits
- Providing detailed logging and state management
- Supporting both DEX-to-CEX and CEX-to-DEX arbitrage

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Cardano node (for transaction submission)
- Gleec Exchange API credentials
- Blockfrost API key
- Cardano wallet with payment and stake keys
- Sufficient ADA for transaction fees
- The token you want to arbitrage must be listed on both Gleec Exchange and Cardano DEXs
